# Elegant Card Game front-end

This school project consists of an online card game created within 24 hours in a team of five students. The features include an authentication system using username and password, a card purchasing/selling system, a waiting room to join a game, a turn-based combat system, statistics for cards and money, and an in-game instant messaging system with persistent message history. The application follows a microservices architecture, with a React front-end and multiple back-ends using Node.js and Java Spring Boot. ActiveMQ message broker is also utilized for notifications and user management, while a reverse proxy is used for communication between the different services. The messaging, notification, and combat systems use web sockets developed with Socket.io on Node.js.
